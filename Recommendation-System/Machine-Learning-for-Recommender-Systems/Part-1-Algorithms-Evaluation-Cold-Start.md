## Algorithms
* **Recommendation System** = software systems providing **suggestions** for users utilizing **historical interactions** and **attributes** of items/users
* modern recommenders combine both approaches (CB, CF)
### CB v. CF
* Content-based
    * using attributes of items/users
    * recommending itmes similar to those **liked by the user in the past**
* Collaborative Filtering
    * recommending items liked by **similar users**
    * allows diverse recommendation â†’ how can we enable users to discover **new** content that is **dissimilar** to items viewd in the past?
